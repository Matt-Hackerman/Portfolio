                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Matthew Hackman. I am 23 years old and enjoy programming because it allows me to create something from a blank slate.  Gaming is one of my personal hobbies and I have always been curious to know how a game is developed. 
                    For a better understanding of computer programs and development, I enrolled in the Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology Computer Software Engineering Technology (CSET) Associates Program. 
                    The CSET program has provided me with an understanding of how to design, develop, and build customized software programs for specific applications. 
                    Programming takes a lot of team work to produce a high-quality product for the company or client.  I work well with others and like solving problems, which is the main reason for my interest in programming. 
                    I like to solve issues by creating solutions to what different customers or industries need.  When working with team members, I interact with others in a helpful way and do well explaining solutions. 
                    I also focus on active listening in order to consider differing points of view.
